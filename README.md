Hi! I'm chris. 😃

Last year I retired from the financial services industry after 20+ years. Since then I've returned to may childhood passion of coding (I guess we called it programming then, LOL). 

As best as I can remember from 40 years ago, below is a representation of one of the first programs I ever wrote, in BASIC, when I was 10. 🚀

I've spent many months taking several courses and exploring a few different languages. I'm still a little unclear about which path I want to follow, but I have come to really like Python. 🐍

In the next few months I'm planning to find ways I can share what I've been learning to help others who are on also this journey. Stay tuned! 😎
