Hi! I'm chris. ðŸ˜ƒ

Last year I retired from the financial services industry after 20+ years. Since leaving work I've returned to may childhood passion of coding (I guess we called it programming then, LOL).

I've spent many months taking several courses and exploring a few different languages. I'm still a little unclear about which path I want to follow, but I have come to especially enjoy Python.

In the next few months I'm planning to find ways that I can share what I've been learning to help others who are on also this journey. Stay tuned!
