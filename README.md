Hi, I’m Chris.

After 20+ years in financial services, I retired in 2019 and returned to coding as a hobby, reconnecting with an interest that started early and never quite went away. Lately, that hobby has turned into a more active practice, focused on building things that are fun, educational, and occasionally useful to others.

I’ve explored a range of languages and learning paths, but Python is now my primary focus. I care about clarity, fundamentals, and understanding how systems work, not just getting something to run.

This GitHub reflects that ongoing journey.
